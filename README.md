# Coronavirus Spread Alabama
This is a map of coronavirus spread through counties in Alabama. Use the slider or the left and right arrows to move days ahead or days back in time. 
The max of the scale is current highest number in a single county, and the scale stays constant regardless of the day your map is currently displaying. 
It's a little fragile, so be gentle. If this ends up getting usage, I'll keep updating it.

If anyone has a live link to consistently updated data, or if anyone wants to add their state counties to it contact me.
